## **🎯 Objective**

To demonstrate a production-style fraud detection workflow by integrating **LightGBM & Random Forest classifiers** with **vectorized transaction feature analysis** and **real-time risk scoring**.

---

## **🛠 Tech Stack**

- **ML Engine:** Tuned **LightGBM (Primary)** and **Random Forest (Deep Scan)** models trained on real credit card fraud datasets.
- **Detection Logic:** Vectorized PCA features (V1–V28) with transaction amount scoring.
- **Backend:** Flask (Python) with model loading via Pickle and REST-based inference APIs.
- **Frontend:** Enterprise-grade UI built using **TailwindCSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Chart.js**.
- **Infrastructure:** Local deployment with modular design, mock fallback inference, and session-based analytics.

---

## **🚀 Implementation Highlights**

- **Multi-Model Inference Engine:** Supports LightGBM for fast production inference and Random Forest for deeper scanning.
- **Auto-Sample Generator:** Instantly populates realistic transaction values using CSV sampling and fallback random generation.
- **Live Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time fraud metrics, confidence trends, and risk distribution visualized via interactive charts.
- **Local Audit Logging:** Stores scan history securely in browser storage with timestamped records.
- **Privacy-First Design:** Zero server-side logging; all history remains on user device only.
